# Exercise: Log Moves

Write a decorator for the `Character.move()` that creates a log message every time the character moves.

If you would like to print the type of moved character inside the decorator, you could use

     print(args[0].__class__)

If you would like to try more sophisticated logging, take a look at [https://www.academis.eu/advanced_python/error_handling/logging.html](https://www.academis.eu/advanced_python/error_handling/logging.html)
